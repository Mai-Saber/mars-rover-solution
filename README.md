-Task Description: 

1- The first part: I see it as how to move the spacecraft based on what has been entered of letters meaning directions,And determine its coordinates after each movement.

2-  The second part: is how to determine that the ship collided with the obstacle, and if it collides (crashed), it must take a step opposite to the step that made it collide, and tell us where it is standing now.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Expected input :

1- x , y : number

2- direction: "string" (north,south,east,west) from which the spacecraft will start
obstacles: array of coordinates

3- string : It is a group of letters as (R,L,F,B) which determines how the spacecraft will move

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Expected output:

1- x,y: it is spacecraft's coordinates which will the spacecraft stand on it
2- direction: which will the spacecraft stand on it

- To clone it to your device : 
1- open empty folder in you device , open the terminal
2- git clone ( repo link)

- To run it:
1- go to the folder where you have cloned in, open the terminal and write:
2- node (file name)
