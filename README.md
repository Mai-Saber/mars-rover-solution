task Description: 
The first part: I see it as how to move the spacecraft based on what has been entered of letters meaning directions,And determine its coordinates after each movement.

 The second part is how to determine that the ship collided with the obstacle, and if it collides (crashed), it must take a step opposite to the step that made it collide, and tell us where it is standing now.

Expected input :
x , y : number
direction: "string" (north,south,east,west) from which the spacecraft will start
obstacles: array of coordinates

Expected output:
x,y: it is spacecraft's coordinates which will the spacecraft stand on it
direction: which will the spacecraft stand on it
